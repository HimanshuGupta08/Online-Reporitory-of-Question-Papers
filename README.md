This is a Web Application project on 'Online Repository of Question Papers'. This project is based on the idea to help students grab their study and examination requirements at one place. The requirements includes the study material of the required subjects like Notes, PPTs, Sample Papers and many more things. Now-a-days, students have to visit different sites to collect the material so this is a good startup to provide everything at one place. 

Initially this project was built for my Post Graduation. But i thought this will be a good idea to help students get data at one place and save time to study more.

Users can add their contribution to help make this project more valuable to everyone.

To install the requirements of this project:
Download the project to one common directory and then run "npm install" in the terminal for 'Admin panel', 'Backend', and 'Frontend' separately. 
Then first run the backend using command 'node index.js'. 
Then run the frontend and admin panel using command 'npm start' separately.
The web app project will soon start on your localhost using the default browser.
